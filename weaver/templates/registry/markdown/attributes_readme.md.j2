# Attribute registry

The attributes registry is the place where attributes are defined. An attribute definition covers the following properties of an attribute:

- the `id` (the fully qualified name) of the attribute
- the `type` of the attribute
- the `stability` of the attribute
- a `brief` description of the attribute and optionally a longer `note`
- example values

Attributes defined in the registry can be used in different semantic conventions. Attributes should be included in this registry before they are used in any application.

A definition of an attribute in the registry doesn't necessarily imply that the attribute is used in any of the semantic conventions.

Application developers MUST only use attributes from this registry.

If you do not see a suitable attribute in this registry, you may define a new attribute and submit it for review.

All registered attributes are listed by namespace in this registry.

Currently, the following namespaces exist:

{% for bundle in ctx %}
{%- set my_file_name = bundle.id | kebab_case ~ ".md" -%}
- [{{ bundle.id | title_case | acronym }}]({{ my_file_name }})
{% endfor %}
